            <span class="headings">CLASSICAL DANCE:</span> 
            <p class="paraabout">
                Classical dance forms use basically the 'mudras' or signs of hand as a common language of
                expression and were originally performed in the temples to entertain various Gods and Goddesses. They
                were
                also
                effective in carrying forward the various mythological stories from generation to generation while
                entertaining
                the audiences. It eventually became a part of 'NatyaShashtra', with time, the classical dances evolved
                to
                include the expressions and themes from social life and experience.
            </p>

            <span class="headings">FOLK DANCE:</span> 
            <p class="paraabout">
                Folk dances are dances developed by groups of people that reflect the traditional life of the people
                of a certain country or region. Folk dance forms are practiced in groups in rural areas as an expression
                of
                their daily work and rituals. They are performed on religious, seasonal festivals or entertainment.
            </p>

            <span class="headings">WESTERN DANCE:</span> 
            <p class="paraabout">
                Dance, along with music, has always dynamically expressed the spirit and personality of every
                culture. Modern western dance is part of this global language and its roots run wide and deep. They can
                be
                traced to the taverns of Ireland and to the ballrooms of Europe, to the Czarist palaces of Russia and
                further
                back still to the fluid tribal rituals of Africa. Representatives from all of these cultures brought
                their
                native dances when they landed in America. Widely differing peoples who had little or no exposure to one
                another
                gathered and danced on common ground.
