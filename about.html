        <h3>Activities Promoted</h3>

        CLASSICAL DANCE:
        <p>
            Classical dance forms use basically the 'mudras' or signs of hand as a common language of
            expression and were originally performed in the temples to entertain various Gods and Goddesses. They were
            also
            effective in carrying forward the various mythological stories from generation to generation while
            entertaining
            the audiences. It eventually became a part of 'NatyaShashtra', with time, the classical dances evolved to
            include the expressions and themes from social life and experience.

        FOLK DANCE:
        <p>
            Folk dances are dances developed by groups of people that reflect the traditional life of the people
            of a certain country or region. Folk dance forms are practiced in groups in rural areas as an expression of
            their daily work and rituals. They are performed on religious, seasonal festivals or entertainment.
        </p>

        WESTERN DANCE:
        <p>
            Dance, along with music, has always dynamically expressed the spirit and personality of every
            culture. Modern western dance is part of this global language and its roots run wide and deep. They can be
            traced to the taverns of Ireland and to the ballrooms of Europe, to the Czarist palaces of Russia and
            further
            back still to the fluid tribal rituals of Africa. Representatives from all of these cultures brought their
            native dances when they landed in America. Widely differing peoples who had little or no exposure to one
            another
            gathered and danced on common ground.
